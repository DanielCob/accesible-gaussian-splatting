# Accessible Gaussian Splatting

An accessible implementation of 3D Gaussian Splatting designed for non-expert users, featuring a simplified, educational, and fully automated pipeline with a Google Colab interface.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start with Google Colab

**[Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DanielCob/accesible-gaussian-splatting/blob/main/accesible_gaussian_splatting.ipynb)**

The Colab notebook provides a complete, user-friendly interface for creating 3D reconstructions from video:

1. **Upload a video** - Simply record a short video orbiting around an object or scene
2. **Automated preprocessing** - The notebook automatically extracts frames and prepares the data
3. **Training** - Trains a 3D Gaussian Splatting model with optimized parameters
4. **Export results** - Download your 3D model for visualization in various tools

No complex setup, dependencies, or command-line experience required!

## About This Project

This repository adapts the [original 3D Gaussian Splatting implementation](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting) by Kerbl et al. to make it more accessible for educational purposes and non-expert users.

**Developed by:** Daniel Cob Beirute, Instituto TecnolÃ³gico de Costa Rica (2025)

**Based on:** "3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering" by Kerbl, Kopanas, LeimkÃ¼hler, and Drettakis

## Features

- **Google Colab Integration** - Run everything in your browser with free GPU access
- **Simplified Workflow** - Automated pipeline from video to 3D model
- **Educational Focus** - Clear documentation and user-friendly interface
- **No Local Setup Required** - All dependencies handled automatically in Colab
